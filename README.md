**## Project: Price Tag Detection and Cropping##**
-------------------------------------------------
**# Description**
------------
This project involves detecting and cropping price tags from images using OpenCV and Python. 
It includes various steps such as image processing, contour detection, and saving the cropped price tag images.

**#Directory Structure**
------------------------
1. cropped_images/image_with_bounding_box.jpg: An image showing the bounding boxes used for cropping price tags.

2. PriceTag_1.jpg to PriceTag_18.jpg: Individual cropped images of price tags.

3. data/PriceTagsList.jpg: An image containing a list of price tags.

4. demo_video.mp4: A demo video showcasing the process or results of the project.

5. PriceTags_Separations.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing code for separating and processing price tags.

**#Usage**
--------
1. Cropped Images: The cropped_images directory contains individual price tag images that have been cropped from a larger image.

2. Data: The data directory contains additional resources such as a list of price tags.

3. Demo Video: The demo_video.mp4 file provides a visual demonstration of the project's workflow or results.

4. Jupyter Notebook: The PriceTags_Separations.ipynb notebook includes the code and steps for processing the price tags.
